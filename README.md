# Foundation of Intelligence: Review of Math Word Problems from Human Cognition Perspective (FoI-MWP)

> A curated survey of mathematical reasoning research from the perspective of **human cognition**.

This repository provides a structured overview of mathematical reasoning models ‚Äî not from the traditional "architectural" perspective, but through the lens of **human cognitive abilities**.  
We summarize, categorize, and compare existing work based on how well they align with the core cognitive processes used in human mathematical reasoning.

---

## üîç Motivation

Mathematical reasoning is a cognitive process involving problem comprehension, knowledge recall, logical reasoning, and self-reflection. However, most surveys classify models by architecture (e.g., Seq2Seq vs Seq2Tree), lacking a **human-centered cognitive viewpoint**.

This survey reframes mathematical reasoning research by mapping model designs and reasoning techniques to **five key cognitive abilities**, making the field more interpretable and pedagogically aligned with human learning.

## üß† Cognitive Framework of Mathematical Reasoning

We identify **five core cognitive abilities** essential for mathematical reasoning:

| Cognitive Ability | Description | Examples in Human Behavior |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| üß≠ **Problem Understanding** | Comprehend the problem, extract key information, formalize the goal | Reading, abstraction, problem reformulation |
| üß© **Logical Organization** | Structure reasoning steps coherently and logically | Step-by-step proofs, structured solution plans |
| üîó **Associative Memory** | Retrieve relevant experiences to solve problems | Recall formulas, known patterns, similar questions |
| üßê **Critical Thinking** | Self-reflection, self-correction, verification, counterfactual reasoning | Check mistakes, refine solutions, compare approaches |
| üìö **Knowledge Learning** | Learn, store, and apply explicit domain knowledge (math rules, formulas) | Study, memorize, apply new theorems |

---

## üèóÔ∏è Model Categorization

We categorize mathematical reasoning models into two major families:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **(Small) Neural Network Solvers**

These models solve math problems directly via neural architectures without large-scale language pretraining. They imitate specific cognitive abilities and generate mathematical expressions as solutions.

### ‚úÖ 2. **LLM-based Solvers**

LLM-based solvers utilize language models to perform and explain reasoning. They solve MWPs by generating a rational, within which they unify multiple human cognitive abilities.
